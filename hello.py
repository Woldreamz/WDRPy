# @hidden_cell (To contribute Python code to this repository, I//ll provide you with a basic example of a Python function. This example will define a simple function that takes two numbers and returns their sum. You can use this as a starting point for writing Python code.)

# @hidden_cell(type:Generated,lang:Python,path:,lines:0-0)

def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b

# Example usage
result = add_numbers(5, 3)
print("The sum is:", result)

# Remember, when working with Python or any programming language, it's essential to understand the requirements and context of what you're developing.
# This example is fundamental, but Python is capable of much more complex and versatile applications, including web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and more.)


# Certainly! Building on the previous example, let's create a Python class that encapsulates the functionality of a simple calculator. This class will include methods for adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing two numbers. 

#```type:Generated,lang:Python,path:,lines:0-0
class SimpleCalculator:
    def add(self, a, b):
        return a + b

    def subtract(self, a, b):
        return a - b

    def multiply(self, a, b):
        return a * b

    def divide(self, a, b):
        if b == 0:
            return "Error: Cannot divide by zero."
        return a / b

# Example usage
calculator = SimpleCalculator()
print("Addition:", calculator.add(10, 5))
print("Subtraction:", calculator.subtract(10, 5))
print("Multiplication:", calculator.multiply(10, 5))
print("Division:", calculator.divide(10, 5))
#print("Multiplication:", calculator.```


# This example demonstrates defining a class in Python, creating methods within that class, and handling a basic error scenario (division by zero). Classes and objects are fundamental to Python's approach to object-oriented programming (OOP). This example should serve as a solid foundation for more complex applications and functionalities you may wish to develop.


#Certainly! Let's start with some very basic Python code snippets that cover fundamental concepts like variables, data types, loops, and conditionals. These examples are great for beginners or as a quick refresher.

### Variables and Data Types

#```type:Generated,lang:Python,path:,lines:0-0
name = "Adrenaline"
age = 30
is_programmer = True
#```



# This example demonstrates how to create variables in Python. `name` is a string, `age` is an integer, and `is_programmer` is a boolean value.

### Lists and Looping

#```type:Generated,lang:Python,path:,lines:0-0
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
#```



#Here, we define a list of fruits and iterate over it using a `for` loop, printing each fruit to the console.

### Conditional Statements

#```type:Generated,lang:Python,path:,lines:0-0
age = 18
if age &gt;= 18:
    print("You are an adult.")
else:
    print("You are a minor.")
#```



# This snippet uses an `if` statement to check the age and prints a message based on whether the age is 18 or older.

### Functions

# ```type:Generated,lang:Python,path:,lines:0-0
def greet(name):
    return "Hello, " + name + "!"

print(greet("Adrenaline"))
#```


# This example defines a simple function named `greet` that takes one parameter (`name`) and returns a greeting string. The function is then called with the argument `"Adrenaline"`.

# These examples cover some of the most basic concepts in Python. They serve as the building blocks for more complex programming tasks and are essential for anyone beginning to learn Python.
