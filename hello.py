# @hidden_cell (To contribute Python code to this repository, I//ll provide you with a basic example of a Python function. This example will define a simple function that takes two numbers and returns their sum. You can use this as a starting point for writing Python code.)

# @hidden_cell(type:Generated,lang:Python,path:,lines:0-0)

def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b

# Example usage
result = add_numbers(5, 3)
print("The sum is:", result)

# Remember, when working with Python or any programming language, it's essential to understand the requirements and context of what you're developing.
# This example is fundamental, but Python is capable of much more complex and versatile applications, including web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and more.)


# Certainly! Building on the previous example, let's create a Python class that encapsulates the functionality of a simple calculator. This class will include methods for adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing two numbers. 

#```type:Generated,lang:Python,path:,lines:0-0
class SimpleCalculator:
    def add(self, a, b):
        return a + b

    def subtract(self, a, b):
        return a - b

    def multiply(self, a, b):
        return a * b

    def divide(self, a, b):
        if b == 0:
            return "Error: Cannot divide by zero."
        return a / b

# Example usage
calculator = SimpleCalculator()
print("Addition:", calculator.add(10, 5))
print("Subtraction:", calculator.subtract(10, 5))
print("Multiplication:", calculator.multiply(10, 5))
print("Division:", calculator.divide(10, 5))
#print("Multiplication:", calculator.```


# This example demonstrates defining a class in Python, creating methods within that class, and handling a basic error scenario (division by zero). Classes and objects are fundamental to Python's approach to object-oriented programming (OOP). This example should serve as a solid foundation for more complex applications and functionalities you may wish to develop.


#Certainly! Let's start with some very basic Python code snippets that cover fundamental concepts like variables, data types, loops, and conditionals. These examples are great for beginners or as a quick refresher.

### Variables and Data Types

#```type:Generated,lang:Python,path:,lines:0-0
name = "Adrenaline"
age = 30
is_programmer = True
#```



# This example demonstrates how to create variables in Python. `name` is a string, `age` is an integer, and `is_programmer` is a boolean value.

### Lists and Looping

#```type:Generated,lang:Python,path:,lines:0-0
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
#```



#Here, we define a list of fruits and iterate over it using a `for` loop, printing each fruit to the console.

### Conditional Statements

#```type:Generated,lang:Python,path:,lines:0-0
age = 18
if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult.")
else:
    print("You are a minor.")
#```



# This snippet uses an `if` statement to check the age and prints a message based on whether the age is 18 or older.

### Functions

# ```type:Generated,lang:Python,path:,lines:0-0
def greet(name):
    return "Hello, " + name + "!"

print(greet("Adrenaline"))
#```


# This example defines a simple function named `greet` that takes one parameter (`name`) and returns a greeting string. The function is then called with the argument `"Adrenaline"`.

# These examples cover some of the most basic concepts in Python. They serve as the building blocks for more complex programming tasks and are essential for anyone beginning to learn Python.

# Certainly! Let's expand upon the fundamentals with more complex Python code snippets that demonstrate different aspects of the language, including list comprehensions, dictionary operations, exception handling, and file I/O. These examples will provide a broader overview of Python's capabilities.

### List Comprehensions

# List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists. The following example creates a list of squares of even numbers from 1 to 10.

#```type:Generated,lang:Python,path:,lines:0-0
squares_of_evens = [x**2 for x in range(1, 11) if x % 2 == 0]
print(squares_of_evens)
#```

### Dictionary Operations

# Dictionaries are key-value pairs in Python. This snippet shows how to create a dictionary, add elements, and iterate over it.

#```type:Generated,lang:Python,path:,lines:0-0
# Creating and populating a dictionary
person = {"name": "Adrenaline", "age": 30, "is_programmer": True}

# Accessing dictionary values
print(person["name"])

# Adding a new key-value pair
person["favorite_language"] = "Python"

# Iterating over dictionary items
for key, value in person.items():
    print(f"{key}: {value}")
#```

### Exception Handling

#Exception handling in Python is crucial for writing resilient programs. This example demonstrates handling a division by zero error.

#```type:Generated,lang:Python,path:,lines:0-0
try:
    a = 10
    b = 0
    print(a / b)
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Error: Cannot divide by zero.")
#```

### File Input/Output (I/O)

# File I/O operations are common in many programming tasks. Here's how to write to a file and then read from it.

#```type:Generated,lang:Python,path:,lines:0-0
# Writing to a file
with open("example.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("Hello, Adrenaline!\nThis is a test file.")

# Reading from a file
with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)
#```

### Working with Classes and Objects

# This example shows how to define a class, create an object, and use class methods.

#```type:Generated,lang:Python,path:,lines:0-0
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name, breed):
        self.name = name
        self.breed = breed

    def bark(self):
        return f"{self.name} says woof!"

# Creating an object of the Dog class
my_dog = Dog("Rex", "German Shepherd")

# Using a class method
print(my_dog.bark())
#```

# These examples cover a broader spectrum of Python's capabilities, from simple operations to more advanced techniques. Through these snippets, one can see the versatility and power of Python as a programming language.

# Building on the previous examples, let's delve into more advanced Python concepts including: working with modules, handling JSON data, utilizing list and dictionary comprehensions further, and introducing lambda functions, decorators, and working with the `datetime` module for date and time manipulation. These examples will showcase Python's robustness and its utility in handling a variety of programming tasks.

### Working with Modules

# Python modules are files containing Python code that can be imported into other Python files. This example demonstrates how to use the `math` module.

#```type:Generated,lang:Python,path:,lines:0-0
import math

# Using a function from the math module
result = math.sqrt(16)
print(result)
#```

### Handling JSON Data

# JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a popular data interchange format. Python provides the `json` module to work with JSON data.

#```type:Generated,lang:Python,path:,lines:0-0
import json

# A Python dictionary
person_dict = {"name": "Adrenaline", "age": 30, "city": "New York"}

# Converting dictionary to JSON string
person_json = json.dumps(person_dict)
print(person_json)

# Converting JSON string back to dictionary
person_dict2 = json.loads(person_json)
print(person_dict2)
#```

### Advanced List and Dictionary Comprehensions

#Comprehensions can be used for more complex data manipulations.

#```type:Generated,lang:Python,path:,lines:0-0
# List comprehension with nested loops
flattened = [val for sublist in [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]] for val in sublist]
print(flattened)

# Dictionary comprehension
squared_dict = {num: num**2 for num in range(1, 6)}
print(squared_dict)
#```

### Lambda Functions

#Lambda functions are small anonymous functions defined with the `lambda` keyword.

#```type:Generated,lang:Python,path:,lines:0-0
# A lambda function that adds 10 to its argument
add_ten = lambda x: x + 10
print(add_ten(5))

# Using lambda with map()
mapped_values = list(map(lambda x: x*2, [1, 2, 3, 4]))
print(mapped_values)
#```

### Decorators

#Decorators provide a simple syntax for calling higher-order functions.

#```type:Generated,lang:Python,path:,lines:0-0
def decorator_function(original_function):
    def wrapper_function():
        print("Wrapper executed this before the original function.")
        return original_function()
    return wrapper_function

@decorator_function
def display():
    print("Display function ran.")

display()
#```

### Working with `datetime`

#The `datetime` module allows you to work with dates and times.

#```type:Generated,lang:Python,path:,lines:0-0
from datetime import datetime

# Getting the current date and time
now = datetime.now()
print(now)

# Formatting date and time
formatted_date = now.strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
print(formatted_date)
# ```

# These examples further illustrate the versatility of Python, demonstrating its capability to handle a wide range of programming tasks, from simple operations to complex data manipulations and beyond.
